# Task3 Online Store
It might seem as one task but let met tell you its not, this task branched into multiple other tasks.

First I was required to create the entities of the provided ERD photo, setup the project, connect with database, create database context class, and then finally start
creating the repositories, and services Moreover, i was asked to implement the DDD (Domain Driven Design) Pattern into my application.

The goal first was to create a Web **API Project** (Application Programming Interface) which i did very well.

Techonologies, Patterns, Tools i have used:
1- Repository Pattern
2- Service Pattern
3- Depedenacy Injection
4- EntityFramework 7
5- Code first migrations
6- Wrapper Class (Class which facilitates the injection of multiple repositories by wrapping them all up in one class then injecting that one class alone in order to access
required Repository)
7- Skeletal Class that helps in defining and shaping the repositories that i have to implement 5 general methods which are (Get, GetAll, Update, Delete, Add)
8- Dealt and configued Swagger
9- Used Authorization and Authentication
10- Hashed each and every user's password into the database
11- Generating a token for each user that loggs in
12- Understanding of Tokens
13- Interacted and coded a lot with LINQ
14- One to one Relationship, One to Many, One to One

Then after all of that i was asked to make a new asp.net MVC (Model-View-Controller) Web Application and then implement all the basic CRUD operations for couple of 
Database tables.

And then i did, although i took an asp course in the university earlier when i was a student i had forgotten how to actually work with the framework. Luckily i kept passing 
each and every task that had been given to me by researching throughouly, understanding, trying, and solving all the problems and bugs that i face.

Lastly they told me to leave the current web project and create a new one instead but this time an actual website that actually works and corresponds with the ERD we had worked upon 
in an earlier task.
